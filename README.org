Make the org-mode link exported as HTML open in a new tab.

* Usage

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load "org"
  (require 'org-newtab-link))
#+end_src

In org-mode:

#+begin_src org
,#+html_link_newtab: t
,* Chapter1

[​[https://example.com/]] and [​[https://example.org/]] will open in new tabs.

,#+attr_html: :target _self
[​[https://example.com/]] will open in the same tab because the target attribute is explicitly specified. [​[https://example.org/]] will open in a new tab because attr_html does not affect the second link in the paragraph .

[​[*Chapter1][Chapter1]] will open in the same tab.
#+end_src

The variable ~org-newtab-link-enabled~ can be a file-local variable or a directory-local variable.
